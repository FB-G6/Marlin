## Example Configurations

Before building Marlin you'll need to configure it for your specific hardware. Your vendor should have already provided source code with configurations for the installed firmware, but if you ever decide to upgrade you'll need updated configuration files. Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested example configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building FB-G6 (Marlin)

**Install PlatformIO**

Linux:
```
source ~/.platformio/penv/bin/activate
platformio run -e mks_robin_nano_v3
```

Simulator mode (Linux):
```
# Activate virtual env
source ~/.platformio/penv/bin/activate
# Change Configuration.h un comment
# #define MOTHERBOARD BOARD_LINUX_RAMPS  // Config for Simulator mode
# Run and build simulator
platformio run -e simulator_linux_release
# Run simulator mode
.pio/build/simulator_linux_release/MarlinSimulator
```

FB-G6 (Marlin) is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use FB-G6 (Marlin) firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep FB-G6 (Marlin) open, and you must provide your compatible FB-G6 (Marlin) source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the FB-G6 (Marlin) license is to make a fork of FB-G6 (Marlin) on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
